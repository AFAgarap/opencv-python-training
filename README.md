OpenCV-Python Tutorials
===

* **0-Introduction to Machine Vision**. Based on the [Lecture 1 from CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2018/cs231n_2018_lecture01.pdf), we briefly introduce machine vision as it developed from several researches in animal vision to mechanical vision to neuroscience.
* **1-Introduction to Python Programming** [[notebook](notebooks/0-introduction-to-python.ipynb)]. A brief introduction to Python programming.
* **2-Introduction to NumPy** [[notebook](notebooks/1-introduction-to-numpy.ipynb)]. A brief introduction to NumPy based on [Justin Johnson's notes in CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).
* **3-Introduction to OpenCV.** A brief introduction to OpenCV-Python.
* **4-Image Loading and Saving** [[notebook](notebooks/2-image-loading-and-saving.ipynb)]. A tutorial on loading, displaying, and saving an image.
* **5-Core Operations** [[notebook](notebooks/3-core-operations.ipynb)]. A tutorial on core operations in OpenCV, which includes accessing and modifying pixels, image channels, and image arithmetic.
* **6-Machine Learning for Image Classification** [[notebook](notebooks/4-machine-learning.ipynb)] . A brief introduction on machine learning using kNN and Linear SVM for image classification.
* **7-Preprocessing using Mean Normalization and PCA** [[notebook](notebooks/5-image-preprocessing.ipynb)]. A tutorial on mean normalization and principal component analysis as preprocessing techniques for machine learning.
* **8-Real-time Image Classification using TensorFlow and OpenCV** [[notebook](notebooks/6-real-time-image-classifier.ipynb)]. Using MobileNet architecture written in TensorFlow for OpenCV as real-time classifier.
