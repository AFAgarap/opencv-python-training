**[0-Introduction to Machine Vision](https://tinyurl.com/y8auw3ez)**. Based on the [Lecture 1 from CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2018/cs231n_2018_lecture01.pdf), we briefly introduce machine vision as it developed from several researches in animal vision to mechanical vision to neuroscience.
