    "The steps of Canny Edge Detection algorithm are as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise Reduction.** Edge detection is susceptible to noise in an image, the first step is noise removal in an image (e.g. using Gaussian filter).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding Intensity Gradient of an image.** Smoothened image is then filtered with a Sobel kernel in both horizontal and vertical direction. From the two images, we can find the edge gradient and the direction for each pixel as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Edge\\_Gradient(G) = \\sqrt{G^{2}_{x} + G^{2}_{y}} \\\\\n",
    "Angle(\\theta) = tan^{-1} \\Bigg(\\dfrac{G_{y}}{G_{x}}\\Bigg)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient direction is always perpendicular to edges. It is rounded to one of four angles representing vertical, horizontal, and two diagonal directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-maximum Suppression.** After getting gradient magnitude and direction, pixels that do not constitute an edge are removed. For this, every pixel is checked if it is a local maximum in its neighborhood in the direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hysteresis Thresholding.** The algorithm decides which are all edges and which are not. For this, we need two threshold values, `minVal` and `maxVal`. Any edges with intensity gradient more than `maxVal` are sure to be edges, and those below `minVal` are not, hence they are discarded. Those that lie between the thresholds are classified as edges or non-edges based on their connectivity. If they are conneccted to \"sure-edge\" pixels, they are considered a part of the edge. Otherwise, they are discarded."
